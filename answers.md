- **Green**: Low traffic areas, possibly indicating better flow or less car dependency.

### 3. Green Space:
- **Green**: Areas with more green spaces, such as parks and recreational areas.
- **Red**: Areas lacking green spaces, often more urbanized, indicating a need for parks or recreational spaces.

### 4. Crime Rate:
- **Red**: High-crime areas, requiring more security measures, social intervention, or improved infrastructure to reduce crime.
- **Green**: Low-crime areas, suggesting better safety and security.

### 5. Air Quality:
- **Red**: Poor air quality, indicating high pollution levels and potential need for environmental interventions.
- **Green**: Good air quality, suggesting a healthier and more sustainable environment.

### 6. Housing Density:
- **Red**: High-density housing areas, indicating overcrowded conditions and potential issues like increased traffic and reduced quality of life.
- **Green**: Low-density housing areas, which may indicate more open space but fewer housing opportunities.

### 7. Commercial Area Percentage:

# Feature Importance Analysis and Urban Planning Simulation
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1de774e-bdf8-41ed-8551-863901d57b7f)

## Feature Importance Analysis:
The **Feature Importance Analysis** tool helps you understand the relative significance of different factors affecting the selected **target variable**. In your case, **population** is chosen as the target variable.

### Available Target Variables:
The target variable can be selected from more than 10 available options such as:
- **Population**
- **Traffic**
- **Drainage**
- **Green Space**
- **Crime Rate**
- **Air Quality**
- **Commercial Area** and more.

These variables represent different aspects of urban life, and understanding how they relate to population (or any other chosen target) helps in making informed urban planning decisions.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: `72701.11`
  - This value indicates the average squared difference between predicted and actual values. Lower MSE values show better accuracy in predicting the target variable (population in this case).
  
- **R-squared Score**: `1.00`
  - An R-squared score of `1.00` means the model explains 100% of the variance in the target variable (population). This indicates a perfect fit between the model and data, suggesting that the selected features are highly predictive.

## Urban Planning Simulation:
Once the feature importance is understood, the **Urban Planning Simulation** allows you to create and simulate your own urban plan. This is done by adjusting various factors that influence city development.

### Focus Area for Proposals:
You can choose to focus on one or more areas for improvement, such as:
- **Traffic Optimization**: Improving traffic flow and reducing congestion.
  
### Key Variables for Custom Urban Plan Simulation:
You can adjust the following parameters to create a custom urban plan:
1. **Increase in Green Space (%)**: 
   - Set a percentage (0% to 100%) for how much green space you want to add. Green spaces can improve quality of life and contribute to environmental sustainability.
  
2. **Public Transport Expansion (%)**: 
   - Set a percentage (0% to 100%) for expanding public transport systems to reduce traffic congestion and improve accessibility.
  
3. **Renewable Energy Adoption (%)**: 
   - Set the adoption percentage (0% to 100%) for renewable energy sources like solar, wind, etc. This can help reduce carbon emissions and promote sustainability.
  
4. **Investment in Smart City Technologies (Million $)**: 
   - Set an investment amount (from $0 to $1,000 million) to improve technology infrastructure, such as smart grids, IoT devices, or AI-powered systems.
  
5. **Number of New Affordable Housing Units**: 
   - Set the number of new affordable housing units (e.g., 1,000 units) to address housing shortages and improve living standards.

### Simulation of Urban Plan:
- By adjusting these parameters, the tool simulates how your proposed changes will impact various aspects of urban life, such as:
  - Traffic flow
  - Green space availability
  - Energy consumption
  - Housing affordability
  - Public transport accessibility
  
This enables you to assess the effectiveness of your proposals before implementation, helping in creating more efficient and sustainable urban environments.
